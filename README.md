==========
In the files and folders here you can find the code used on the website trefyranio.com. The code for the full model as well as for some of the commonly used graphs is now available. I've also posted the code for my 2014-08-29 post about how to measure the support of the Sweden democrats. The goal is to make the code for all of my posts available online to ensure reproducability and transparency. 

To use the code you need to have the R statistical software (and preferably R Studio) installed. Make sure that you have the latest version of R installed (at least version 3.1.0) You also need to install all the packages used in code. The packages that are used are called in the beginning of the code through the "library" function, but you need to download them yourself before they can be called.

The dataset used for the forecasts can be found at https://github.com/MansMeg/SwedishPolls. This dataset is imported into R automatically when you run the forecast code.
