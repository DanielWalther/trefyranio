trefyranio
==========
In the files and folders here you can find the code used on the website trefyranio.com. So far only the most recently used code is available, but the goal is to provide all the code both for the forecasts themselves and for all individual blog posts.

To use the code you need to have the R statistical software (and preferably R Studio) installed. You also need to install all the packages used in code. The packages that are used are called in the beginning of the code through the "library" function, but you need to install them yourself before they can be called.

The dataset used for the forecasts can be found at https://github.com/MansMeg/SwedishPolls. This dataset is imported into R automatically when you run the forecast code.
